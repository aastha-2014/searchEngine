# searchEngine
It is a simple search engine coded in python capable of answering single-word search queries efficiently.  The user needs to give a seed page url as input. The seed page can be any valid url which is used by the program to crawl the web. A good seed page is the one with many links embedded in it as it helps to crawl the web quite efficiently.  Given the seed page url, the program takes a coule of minutes (usually 15-20 min) depending upon the seed page ,to fetch and preprocess the data crawled.
